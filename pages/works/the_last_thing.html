                    The last thing you had takes its title from Korean author Park Wan-suh’s novel [The last thing I had], which portrays a
                    mother’s grief over her son’s death during a protest. The work reflects on the line, “What matters
                    is not whether he was an activist, but that the times were so dark that he could not help but make
                    even his death a torch.” Through this perspective, the piece contemplates a period when human life
                    itself was consumed in the pursuit of light. It is an elegy for those who were lost and a quiet
                    mourning for the darkness of history that demanded such sacrifice.
