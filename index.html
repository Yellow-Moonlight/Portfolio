            Welcome to my portfolio.
            <br>
            <br>

            This website started with a simple question: Is it possible to have a low-weight portfolio website for an
            artist? I aim to keep this site as small as possible, so all images are dithered. If you want to see the
            original files, just click on them—but if you hover your mouse over a photo, you’ll see its original file
            size.
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal is to reduce the carbon footprint caused whenever someone visits my portfolio. In the long run, I
            hope to even host this website entirely on solar power.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most art portfolios online are heavy. Artists take high-resolution photos to document their work well, then
            upload them online so people can see them in detail. I’ve felt a little conflicted about this. The
            images we see on the web are never the same as experiencing the artwork in real life, and they can only
            convey part of what the work is.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m not sure if this is the “right” choice, but I wanted to give it a try. Art is all about visual images,
            and it might feel counterintuitive to sacrifice some of that in a portfolio—but sometimes letting go of
            perfection can be a meaningful experiment.
