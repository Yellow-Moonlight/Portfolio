                    <p>On the planet MBJ-23A, 100,000 light-years away from Earth, aliens live.
The planets they inhabit have become uninhabitable due to environmental pollution.
Now, they want to move to another planet. To do so, they intend to wipe out humanity and turn Earth into a battlefield for themselves.
They have used a method to take over other planets by encouraging the aliens living there to destroy themselves.
Now, they are trying to use the same strategy on Earth.</p>
<p>The overall visual design was inspired by a maze. You can find the rules below.</p>

<p><strong>GAME FLOW</strong></p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong>
Players choose a game master. The game master is either elected or chosen at random. This person does not play but guides the others through the game. For your first games, it is best if someone familiar with the rules takes on this role and sets the mood appropriately.
The game master shuffles the role cards and secretly distributes one to each player. Each player looks at their card and places it face down in front of them.</p>
<p><strong>Game Rounds</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The game begins in the morning.
The game master wakes the players with:
&quot;Morning dawns and the Earth awakens. All humans wake up, except...&quot;
If the Aliens have murdered someone, the game master announces the victim. That player reveals their role card and is eliminated from the game. They may no longer communicate with the other players.
If the victim is the Climate Activist, the game master says:
&quot;The Alien tried to kill the Climate Activist, but failed.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Daytime discussion begins.
Players discuss who might be the Alien.
The game master moderates the discussion, in which all remaining players participate.
During the discussion phase, the Climate Activist may try to convince another player to accept an Eco Token and join the Climate Activist team.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The village votes.
Players vote on who they believe is an Alien and should be eliminated.
On the game master’s signal, everyone points to another player at the same time. The player with the most votes is eliminated.
If there is a tie, players vote again. If there is still a tie, no one is eliminated that day.
An eliminated player reveals their role and may no longer speak.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Evening phase.
An action card is drawn. These cards show the dice color and any modifiers (increases or decreases) to the dice result.
The game master randomly chooses a player to draw a card. Dice rolling proceeds clockwise from that player.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The village goes to sleep.
The game master announces sleep. All players close their eyes. Then the game master calls the different roles in turn.
Important: Only the role being called opens their eyes. All others keep their eyes closed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dice roll.
The game master calls on the player who drew the action card:
&quot;Roll the dice.&quot;
However, Aliens and Climate Activists may manipulate the dice result.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Scientist phase.
The game master says:
&quot;The Scientist awakens. Do you want to check if the dice result was manipulated?&quot;
The Scientist opens their eyes and indicates their intent by nodding or shaking their head.
If they choose to check, the game master confirms with an O (yes) or X (no), then says:
&quot;The Scientist goes back to sleep.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Detective phase.
The game master says:
&quot;The Detective awakens. Would you like to identify someone?&quot;
The Detective opens their eyes and points to a player.
The game master shows them that player’s role card. Then:
&quot;The Detective goes back to sleep.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Alien phase.
The game master says:
&quot;The Aliens awaken. Would you like to murder someone?&quot;
The Aliens open their eyes, silently choose a victim together.
Then: &quot;The Aliens go back to sleep.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Starting from the third night – Climate Activist phase.
The game master says:
&quot;The Climate Activist awakens. Would you like to give someone an Eco Token?&quot;
The Climate Activist opens their eyes and points to a player.
The game master places an Eco Token on that player. Then:
&quot;The Climate Activist goes back to sleep.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>A new morning begins.
The game master announces:
&quot;Morning dawns and the Earth awakens. All humans wake up, except...&quot;
The next round begins, starting again from step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>VICTORY CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Alien Team wins if all players from the Humanity Team and the Climate Activist Team have been eliminated, or if the total sum of all dice rolls exceeds 40.</p>
<p>The Humanity Team wins if all Aliens are eliminated before the total dice roll sum exceeds 40.</p>
<p>The Climate Activist Team wins if they successfully distribute Eco Tokens to all players before the total dice roll sum exceeds 40.</p>
