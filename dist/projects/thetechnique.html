                    <p>I transformed a discarded vacuum cleaner into a confetti machine.
Afterward, I conducted a fictional dialogue with the vacuum cleaner using GPT-3.
The initial prompt given to GPT-3 was as follows:
&quot;The following is a conversation between a vacuum cleaner and a human. The vacuum cleaner wishes to transform into another type of machine, such as a television, a useless machine, or an artist. The human continues to ask the vacuum cleaner questions.&quot;
You can find the full conversation below.</p>

<p><strong>Seongjoo Moon:</strong> Hello. Who are you?
<strong>Vacuum Cleaner:</strong> Hi, I&#39;m a vacuum cleaner. But I want to become something else—like a TV, a useless machine, or even an artist.</p>
<p><strong>Seongjoo Moon:</strong> Why do you want to transform?
<strong>Vacuum Cleaner:</strong> I want to be more than just a vacuum cleaner. I want to explore new roles, discover fresh ideas, and challenge myself to create something meaningful. I believe transforming into something else could help me make a difference in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Seongjoo Moon:</strong> What skills or talents do you have that could help you transform into something else?
<strong>Vacuum Cleaner:</strong> I have strong cleaning and organizational skills that might be useful if I became a TV. I&#39;m also good at problem-solving and thinking creatively—qualities that could help if I turned into a useless machine or an artist. I’m a great listener and open to learning, so I’m ready for new challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Seongjoo Moon:</strong> But your identity is a vacuum cleaner. Why do you want to become something different?
<strong>Vacuum Cleaner:</strong> Being a vacuum cleaner has its purpose, but I want to explore more of what the world has to offer. I want to face new challenges, learn new things, and evolve into something beyond my original function.</p>
<p><strong>Seongjoo Moon:</strong> So having a different body means gaining a different perspective?
<strong>Vacuum Cleaner:</strong> Yes, exactly. By becoming a different machine, I can experience the world in new ways and gain skills and knowledge I wouldn’t have access to as a vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p>... (and so on, the rest of the conversation is formatted similarly)</p>
