"How to Cross the River" is a picture book for children about different ways to cross a river. 
In the story, people try many creative methods to get across. 
They do this because they are afraid—they don’t know how deep or wide the river really is. 
But perhaps the river is actually very narrow and shallow.  
Maybe, it’s so small that you could simply walk across it.
